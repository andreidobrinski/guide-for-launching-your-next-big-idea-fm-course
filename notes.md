# Notes

- passive income is a fantasy
- 90% of startups fail. That's just the ones we know about

Why do SaaS apps fail?

1. don't to solve a real problem. Doesn't solve a meaningful problem for a big enough group of people
2. poor marketing. not a good strategy for acquiring and retaining customers. Best idea in the world could fail because marketing doesn't succeed.
3. no differentiaion. Can't break through if the app isn't meaningfully different from the competition.

Agenda for course
Things to do before you start coding. Validating the idea

1. review the market. see what else is going on in the market
2. understand the audience. who the apps appeals to and what they need/want.

- if you're solving your own problem, are there enough people just like you?

3. define the MVP
4. run a test marketing campaign. Find the difference between what people say and what people do.
