# Notes

- passive income is a fantasy
- 90% of startups fail. That's just the ones we know about

Why do SaaS apps fail?

1. don't to solve a real problem. Doesn't solve a meaningful problem for a big enough group of people
2. poor marketing. not a good strategy for acquiring and retaining customers. Best idea in the world could fail because marketing doesn't succeed.
3. no differentiaion. Can't break through if the app isn't meaningfully different from the competition.

Agenda for course
Things to do before you start coding. Validating the idea

1. review the market. see what else is going on in the market
2. understand the audience. who the apps appeals to and what they need/want.

- if you're solving your own problem, are there enough people just like you?

3. define the MVP
4. run a test marketing campaign. Find the difference between what people say and what people do.

## Review the market

- important to understand what else is addressing the problem that the app is trying to solve

Why do we want to do market research?

- need to define the audience. Get deeper insight into the exact niche you want to target
- define the offering. Get a clearer picture of what you need to build initially
- identify market challenges. Uncover challenges that you might face when you go to market
- establish a strategy

42% of startup fails because there is no market need. Not enough people that want to pay for the product

How to approach market research

1. broadly define the niche

   - type of offering. Rough functionality
   - what specific audience is the focus?
   - avoid going too broad in the market. Need to find a small community

2. find your competitors

   - find who else has done the same thing
   - google, product hunt, g2, peerspot, social media, forums, industry reports, SEO/SEM tools, news and publications
   - pay attention to what people say about competitors
   - talk to the audience

3. try out the competitors' offering

   - sign up for demos and free trials
   - see features, usability
   - customer support, leave them an email with a question
   - create a list of what they do well and don't do well

4. pay attention to competition reach
   - advertising. do they pay for PPC ads? do they appear on relevant websites? are they throwing money at ads?
   - social. how many followers do they have and how often do they post? is the sentimemnt positive or negative?
     - tools:
     - mention: https://mention.com/en/
     - buzzsumo: https://buzzsumo.com/
   - media. how often are they mentioned on media sites? what is their PR like?

Note from instructor: if I'm competing against someone that offered a free option and had big venture backing while I was trying to bootstrap something, I would probably walk away. Other option is to go very niche and not compete directly.

What to look for in competitiors?

- features and functionality
  - What's their core offering? Pay attention to what they focus on promoting the most. Having a different focus could sometimes be enough of a differentiation
  - unique features. what makes their app different? Are the features nice to have or key?
  - integration. what platforms do they integrate with?
- user experience
  - onboarding. is the app easy to pick up?
  - repeat use. how does the experience change over the course of time?
  - accesibility. in the sense of does it work across different platforms?
- market position
  - who is the primary audience that they target?
  - pricing
  - brand
  - how is this app helping their users?
- market strategy
  - digital presence, what is their site like, what wording to they use?
  - content marketing. understand their keywords to understand how they are reaching people.
  - paid advertising, how are they using it?
- customer feedback
  - what reviews and ratings are they getting?
  - look at case studies and testimonials
- company health
  - do they have funding and investment? how recently and how many rounds of investment do they have?
  - investors are very demanding and there are downsides to getting venture capital. a company can implode if it's taken a lot of investment.
  - growth metrics. are they growing/expanding and in which geographical area?
  - innovation
    - newsletters, product updates, release notes
    - a company that is slow to innovate will tend to lose customers over time
    - companies that have release another app since the one you're looking at will typically shift attention to the newer app
    - patents and technologies. Do they have any patents in their name?
- technology
  - performance, is the app fast?
  - reliability, are there bugs? what is uptime like?
  - security, have their been high profile breaches?
  - privacy, what do they do with their customer data?

How to use what you learn

- spot gaps in the market
  - missing features
  - experience gaps
  - audience gaps, is there a niche or region that the competitor has failed to target?

Building your business on top of someone else's business leaves you vulnerable.

- Amazon marketplace. merchants sell on the marketplace, Amazon has the data for what sells well then competes in those markets and is able to undercut
- Building a business on another company's API. Changes to the API policy can destroy a business

How to differentiate

- features and functionality. solve a problem that isn't currenly being adequately addressed
- enhance existing features
  - faster. enable customers to do the same thing except faster
  - better. enable customers to do the same thing but to a higher standard
  - cheaper. same offering as competitiors but with a lower price point
- technology. Competitors might be tied to a legacy stack while you are free to choose something new
- values. people's values change and a new company can appeal to the changing values. For eg, sustainability and privacy are on the rise. Allows the business to tell a better story
- user experience
  - better onboarding, makes the app easier to pick up and start using. Works well when customers are still shopping around for solutions
  - repeat use. better experience for repeat actions
  - accessibility. works on a device or platform that the competition doesn't support
- pricing
  - subscription vs on-off payment
  - freemium, charge for value added features
  - entirely free, ask for tips or donations. pay what you can

Differentiating for different audiences

- for b2b audience
  - vertical. focus on a different vertical sector and build to meet their specific needs
  - size. if competitors focus on enterprise, consider focusing on smaller companies
  - region. focusing features to appeal to a specific region
- for b2c audience
  - focus on different interests. focus on a different use case than a competitors, focus on niche interests
  - demographics. focus on a different age group than a competitors
  - region
- community building
  - business that tries to build a sense of community
  - engage with community. helps you listen to them and understand what they want
  - offer support to solve problems
  - allow people to create things using your platform/product
  - thought leadership. provide advice and articles to help teach the audience on what they're looking to do
- customer support
  - a possible path to differentiation
  - responding quickly
  - responding with personalized messages
  - community-driven support
  - pubishing roadmap to engage with community
  - self-service support
- flexibility
  - allowing users to customize your product
  - opening up APIs
